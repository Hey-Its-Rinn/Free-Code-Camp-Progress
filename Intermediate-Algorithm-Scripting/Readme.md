This function is my solution to this FreeCodeCamp challenge:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/smallest-common-multiple

It finds the smallest common multiple of the two provided parameters that can be evenly divided by both, 
as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.

See flowchart to check out my logic behind it!
